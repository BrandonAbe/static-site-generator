# static-site-generator
Static Site Generator for boot.dev

# Requirements
- Python 3.10+: Several class methods use "match"

# Limitations
- While nested inline elements (such as a bolded italic) exists in nature, the current scope of this project does not allow for such cases. Support for multiple levels of nested inline text types may be added in the future, but is not currently planned.
